# Kanye Rest API Test

This is version 5 of a web application that was used to test my knowledge on API's. Here we are using the [Kanye Rest API](https://kanye.rest/) which displays a random Kanye West quote whenever the application gets refreshed.

To create this application, you can query [this page](https://api.kanye.rest/) to receive a JSON format of a random Kanye West quote.

Please try the [Live Demo](https://ken-yokohama.github.io/react-app-test/) of this application.
